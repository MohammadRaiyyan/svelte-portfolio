			Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable dashboards and AI-driven web
			applications. I focus on creating smooth, user-friendly experiences while keeping performance
			and scalability in mind.
		</p>

		<p>Some of the areas I work on:</p>
		<ul class="space-y-2 list-disc pl-10 xs:text-sm md:text-inherit">
			<li>Designing and integrating APIs that connect applications with AI and data services</li>
			<li>Building interactive dashboards with real-time charts and analytics</li>
			<li>Crafting interfaces that make complex technology simple and accessible</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="md:block hidden">
			My goal is to bridge the gap between modern technology and real-world usability — ensuring
			that solutions are not only functional, but also intuitive to use.
		</p>

		<p class="md:block hidden">
			Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and full-stack side projects using
			React, Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL — exploring where design meets technology.
